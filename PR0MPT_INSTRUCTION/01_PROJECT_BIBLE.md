# Project Title

Integrated Digital System for Barangay Poblacion Health Center Services and Community Notifications (IDS-BPHCSN)

---

# Purpose of this Document

This document serves as the single source of truth for the entire IDS-BPHCSN project.

Its purpose is to provide complete project context for AI assistants, developers, designers, researchers, and project members. Every future task involving UI design, software development, documentation, database design, testing, debugging, or report generation must follow the information contained in this document.

Whenever there is conflicting information between different documents, the approved Capstone Proposal shall be treated as the highest authority.

---

# Project Overview

IDS-BPHCSN is a desktop web-based healthcare management system developed for Barangay Poblacion Health Center.

The system aims to replace manual record keeping with an integrated digital platform that manages patient information, medicine inventory, appointments, community notifications, reports, and administrative functions.

The project is developed as part of the Capstone Project requirement at Northeastern Mindanao Colleges.

---

# Problem Statement

The Barangay Health Center currently experiences challenges associated with manual operations, including:

- Paper-based patient records
- Slow retrieval of patient information
- Manual appointment scheduling
- Inefficient medicine inventory monitoring
- Delayed dissemination of community announcements
- Limited reporting capabilities
- Difficulty tracking healthcare services

These issues reduce operational efficiency and increase the possibility of human error.

---

# Project Objectives

## General Objective

Develop an integrated digital healthcare management system that improves efficiency, organization, and communication within Barangay Poblacion Health Center.

## Specific Objectives

Per the approved Capstone Proposal, the project has exactly four core objectives. These define
project success and must be prioritized above all other work:

1. Digitize and manage patient records (Patient Records, Register Patient, Patient Profile).
2. Manage medicine and supplies inventory, including automated low-stock alerts (Medicine
   Inventory, Add/Edit Medicine).
3. Schedule patient appointments and deliver community notifications (Appointment Scheduling,
   Community Notifications).
4. Generate automated healthcare reports (Reports & Analytics).

Supporting outcomes (improve administrative efficiency, reduce paperwork, improve data
accessibility, support informed decision making) are the expected *results* of achieving the
four core objectives above, not separate objectives to design or build independently.

---

# Target Users

The system supports three user roles.

## Administrator

Responsibilities

- Full system access
- User management
- Dashboard monitoring
- Reports
- Inventory supervision
- System settings
- Audit logs

---

## Health Center Staff

Responsibilities

- Register patients
- Update consultations
- Manage appointments
- Dispense medicines
- Update inventory
- View notifications

---

## Barangay Official

Responsibilities

- View community reports
- Receive health announcements
- Monitor public health activities
- Access authorized information only

---

# System Scope

## Core Objective Modules (per approved Capstone Proposal)

- Patient Records Management
- Patient Profile Management
- Consultation Records
- Medicine Inventory
- Appointment Scheduling
- Community Notifications
- Reports and Analytics

## Supporting Infrastructure Modules

These are necessary for the system to function securely with three distinct roles, but are not
themselves core objectives from the approved Proposal. They should be built after the core
objective modules are functional, not treated as equal priority.

- User Authentication
- Administrator Dashboard
- Health Center Staff Dashboard
- Barangay Official Dashboard
- User Management
- Audit Logs
- System Settings

---

# Out of Scope

The following features are intentionally excluded.

- Online patient self-registration
- Online payment processing
- Telemedicine consultation
- Mobile application
- Artificial Intelligence diagnosis
- Electronic prescriptions
- Integration with external hospital systems

---

# Technology Stack

Frontend

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap 5
- JavaScript

Backend

- Python
- Flask

Database

- SQLite

Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code

Version Control

- Git (optional)

System Architecture

- Client-Server Architecture using a Star Topology. A single centralized Flask/SQLite server
  handles all database operations and application logic; client devices (Admin, Staff, and
  Barangay Official workstations) connect individually to that central server over a local
  network. See 04_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md for full technical detail.

---

# Design Philosophy

The system shall follow a clean, professional, and modern healthcare management interface.

The interface must emphasize:

- Simplicity
- Readability
- Consistency
- Accessibility
- Professional appearance
- Government healthcare aesthetic
- Desktop-first experience

The interface should resemble a production-ready government information system without copying any existing official software.

---

# UI Principles

Every page must maintain the same visual identity.

Consistency is mandatory.

The following elements should remain consistent across all screens:

- Sidebar
- Header
- Typography
- Buttons
- Cards
- Tables
- Colors
- Icons
- Navigation
- Spacing
- Shadows
- Border radius

Only the content area should change between modules.

# AI Collaboration Rules

Artificial Intelligence tools are used as development assistants.

AI may assist in:

- UI Design
- Code Generation
- Documentation
- Debugging
- Database Design
- Testing
- Content Writing

Human project members remain responsible for:

- Reviewing outputs
- Verifying correctness
- Implementing improvements
- Making final decisions

AI-generated content shall always be reviewed before inclusion in the final project.

# Source of Truth Priority

When conflicts occur, follow this order.

1. Approved Capstone Proposal
2. This Project Bible (as of Version 2.0, corrections from 10_PROPOSAL_RECONCILIATION_NOTES.md
   have been merged directly into this document and 04_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md /
   08_PROJECT_ROADMAP.md — the reconciliation file itself now serves only as a historical
   changelog and no longer needs to be actively cross-referenced)
3. UI Design System
4. Screen Specifications
5. Development Guide
6. AI Master Instructions

---

# Success Criteria

The project is considered successful when:

- All required modules are completed.
- User authentication works correctly.
- Patient management functions operate correctly.
- Inventory management functions operate correctly.
- Appointment scheduling functions operate correctly.
- Reports are generated correctly.
- Community notifications function properly.
- The interface remains visually consistent.
- The system demonstrates role-based access control.

# Version History

Version 1.0

Initial Project Bible created for the IDS-BPHCSN Capstone Project.

Version 2.0

Reconciled against the actual approved Capstone Proposal. Specific Objectives and System Scope
reorganized to correctly prioritize the four core objective modules (Patient Records, Medicine
Inventory, Appointment Scheduling + Community Notifications, Reports & Analytics) over
supporting infrastructure (User Management, Audit Logs, Settings). Added System Architecture
(Client-Server, Star Topology). Full detail of what changed and why is preserved in
10_PROPOSAL_RECONCILIATION_NOTES.md.
